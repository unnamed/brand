# Branding

A repository for assets (logos, banners, projects), fonts and brand colors.
Projects are suffixed with `.project.svg` and created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org),
a free and open source vector graphics editor

## Fonts

We only use [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) font

## Generation

There are Python scripts to generate our assets in different colors and sizes, to
install required dependencies you must execute the following command
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and then you can use the scripts to generate the assets in SVG or PNG
